-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
1. Always use the agentcore MCP and strands agent MCP for best practices before any implementation of code related to those frameworks.
2. Do not create an documentationd or test files without asking the user first.
3. Always try write as few code as possible
4. If you are not 100% sure of an implementation as the user for helper, ask the user first.
5. If you're unsure of a terraform resource usage or there is a problem with its fields always use the terraform MCP to check the correct syntax.
